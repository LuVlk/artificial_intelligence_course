## Digit Recognition
An app that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognise handwritten digits.
The database is the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) which contains 60000 samples of handwritten digits for training and 10000 samples for testing.
This project is based on [Data Flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/).

### Prerequisites
The necessary libraries for this project are:

- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras
- pillow

They can be installed using this command:

    pip install numpy, tensorflow, keras, pillow
